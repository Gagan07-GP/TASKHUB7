You are creating a task management tool for your college project using CSS, HTML, and PHP.
Your main page will allow users to add, delete, and manage tasks, and will include sections like 'Get Started' and user suggestions.
The 'Features' link will take users to the second page, and the color category feature will be on the third page after login.
The 'Support' section will include your WhatsApp number and email.
You are considering adding a navigation bar to the main page but are unsure about including a 'Home' link.
You have added a header, description, and images to your homepage, which also features a hero section with a description of the tool, a main image, user testimonials, a 'Get Started' button leading to the login and signup page, and a footer.
You are looking for modern, smaller icons and unique color suggestions for your website.
